## John Diggins Portfolio

<br>

### Description
This is a simple webpage with links to many of the projects I have worked on in the last week.   [click here](https://john-dig.github.io/portfolio/).
<br><br>

### Setup Instructions
  
  Just click the link: [click here](https://john-dig.github.io/portfolio/).  Another way would be to clone the main branch, then open the index.html file.  Both the link (points to the gh-pages branch), and the main branch are identical as of 1/14/2023.

### Technology Used

  #### Software
  
  * VSCode
  * Git and GitHub
  * Google Chrome

  #### Operating Systems
  * Mac OS
  * Linux Ubuntu/ Mint

  #### Formats
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Markdown
<br><br>

  ### Known Issues
  1. There are **many!** All my software could use more work, I need more time!
  2. There are a few issues I'm having with images and text displaying properly.
  3. I'm sure you can find more, if so, please send an email to (dontSend@nowhere.com), with the subject line: _help for your portfolio_.

  <h2>Some More Background</h2>  
    <p>&emsp;  Most of my life up to this point has been dedicated to running my own successful painting business. I completed a year of computer science-related courses at Clackamas Community College after high school, but after about a year of college, I had an opportunity to start my own business.  Through my business, I gained valuable experience in construction trades, business management, hiring and firing employees,  working with clients, and everything else involved in running a small business. 

     Currently, many years after starting in Computer Science, I'm returning to my passion for learning and working with computer programming languages.  I'm happy and grateful for the transition.  I feel better suited to this kind of work. 

   For most of my life, I've been consistently involved in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which has been an incredibly valuable and fulfilling experience. Through my involvement in the jiu-jitsu and self-defense martial arts community, I've gained a wealth of knowledge and skills that have benefited me in many aspects of my life. As a coach and competitor in jiu-jitsu, I've had the opportunity to interact with a wide array of individuals from around the world. Coaching and competing with people from different backgrounds has helped me to develop my communication skills and gain a better understanding of different perspectives.</p>

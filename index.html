  <h2>Some More Background</h2>  
    <p>&emsp; I have <em>some</em> computer experience. But most of my life up to this point has been occupied by other things.  I did take about 1 year of computer science related courses at Clackamas Community College shortly after I graduated high school.  Then I was enticed by the idea of running my own painting business, so I did that.  It's been successful, I've had many clients and also employees.  I've learned all about the construction trades, running a business, hiring and firing, and communicating with clients .  That's one thing I feel I've been very good at: making sure to satisfy and take care of even the most difficult clients.  <span>It's particularly</span> satisfying to turn a frown upside down. <br>&emsp; Nearly 20 years after starting some CS classes in college, I'm finally getting back to what I really want to do. Learning and working with computer programming languages has been great.  <br>&emsp; I've also been heavily involved in Brazilian jiu jitsu, that's where I've actually met most of the coders/ IT folks I know, and what inspired me to get into the boot camp I'm currently a student of.  Along with that I have been a competitor, and a coach for many years.  I've coached and taught individuals from 5 years old to 70 years old.</p>

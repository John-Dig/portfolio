    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Besides the other thing I like to do (more about that later), I'm just a guy who thought he might be too old to get back into computers.  I've enjoyed tech since even before 1990 when my family got our first computer.  Here's some specs on that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>286 running at 16Mhz</li>
      <li>1MB of RAM</li>
      <li>40MB Hard drive</li>
      <li>Microsoft DOS 4.0</li>
      <li>onboard graphics card</li>
      <li>VGA monitor (640x480)</li>
      <li>24 pin dot-matrix printer</li>
      <li>Sound Blaster 16 sound card (added later)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Background</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Painting Contractor 20 years</li>
      <li>Electronics trade school 3 years</li>
      <li>Computer Scince 1 year </li>
      <li>Jiu Jitsu student/teacher 20 years</li>

    

  <p>I have some computer experience. But more life experience.  I did take about 1 year of computer science related courses at Clackamas Comunity College shortly after I graduated high school.  Then I was inticed by the idea of running my own painting buisiness, so I did that.  It's been successful, I've had many clients and also employees.  I've learned all about the construction trades, running a buisiness, hiring and firing, communicating with clients (I feel confident that I can work with even the most difficult customers), and everything.  Nearly 20 years later, and I'm finally getting back to what I really want to do; something that can fully challenge my brain!  I've also been heavily involved in Brazilian jiu jitsu, that's where I've actually met most of the coders/ IT folks I know, and what inspired me to get into this boot camp!  Along with that I have been a competitor, and a coach for many years.  I've coached and taught individuals from 5 years old to 70 years old.  I've also made friends of every type of individual.</p>
